This project is a mini porfolio website I made using html, css and a little bit of JavaScript.
Even though it was first meant to be a simple landing page to stack all my socials links, I ended up adding some of my projects and some more presentation

The website is design by section:
- profile section
- about section
- projects section
- contact section

I have one html file and two css files (one for normal styling and one for mediaqueries to adjust styling on small displays) and one folder to stock all images and icons that I used.
