This is a simple/responsive landing page I wanted to build to put on my social media biographies.
It essentially just is a page to quickly present myself, what I do, the tools I'm familiar working with as well as my contact details.
I was helped by a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/@howtobecomeadeveloper) but I did not ctrl-c ctrl-v lol!
I principally used HTML and CSS. 

Considering to add a dark/light theme switcher in the future.
